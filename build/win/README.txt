                           Windows edition


Installation

1. Open stop.jse. This will stop any running LWFS instance.

2. Remove previously installed LWFS applications.

3. Copy this folder onto your drive, such as under C:/.


Start/Stop LWFS
===============

* Open start.jse or start-remote.jse. This starts LWFS and open a
  browser.

  * If you open start.jse, the browser will connect to the web server
    that LWFS invokes on the local PC. You can work even if you are
    offline.

  * If you open start-remote.jse, the browser will connect to the
    common remote web server. You can easily share conversion results
    with others.

* Open stop.jse to stop LWFS.
