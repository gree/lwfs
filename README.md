# LWFS

LWFS is a daemon that generates lwf files from swf/fla files. It
monitors ~/Desktop/LWFS_work/ and generates lwf files automatically
when any files under the directory change. After generating lwf files,
it opens http://local-host-name:10080/lwfs/uuid/list/ with your
default browser to show the conversion results.

## Quick Start

https://github.com/gree/lwfs/downloads contains prebuilt binaries and
examples for Mac OS X and Windows. If you just want to use LWFS,
please try them. You don't need to read INSTALL.md that contains more
details for programmers.
