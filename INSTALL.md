# Installation

## Preparation

NOTE: Release materials for end-users are built by utilizing pre-build
runtimes. Please check build/{osx,win} for details. Runtimes
themselves are built under build/{osx,win}/runtime.

### Mac OS X

1. Install Xcode and its command line tools.
2. Install Homebrew (https://brew.sh/).
3. Follow the steps below:

        brew install rbenv ruby-build
        rbenv install 2.3.4
        bundle install --no-cache

### Mac OS X (JRuby)

1. Install Xcode and its command line tools.
2. Install Homebrew (https://brew.sh/).
3. Follow the steps below:

        brew install rbenv ruby-build
        rbenv install jruby-1.7.26
        bundle install --no-cache

### Linux

1. Install gcc
2. Install rbenv and ruby-build (cf. https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#readme, https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#readme).
3. Follow the steps below:

        rbenv install 2.3.4
        bundle install --no-cache

### Windows

1. Install MinGW ruby-1.9.3 and DevKit (http://rubyinstaller.org/).
2. Install zlib, libpng, libjpeg, libiconv, libxml2 to the DevKit.
3. Follow the steps below:

        gem install bundler
        bundle install --no-cache

### Remote Server

LWFS normally works as a web server running on your PC. If you want to
check your contents on mobile devices, you need to have a WiFi access
point through which they can access to your PC. In order to avoid this
requirement, you can prepare a rsync/web server on some remote (Linux)
host and make LWFS to synchronize converted contents onto the remote
host. Please check remote/ for further details.

### BirdWatcher Server

BirdWatcher (https://github.com/imaya/birdwatcher.js/) is a JavaScript
profiler purely written in JavaScript. It is easy to use even on
mobile devices and can send stats to its node.js server on which a
user can check various graphs/console logs.

By default, LWFS shows a page for each data with the release version
of lwf.js. A user can then switch to the page with the debug version
of lwf.js and/or the page with the debug version of lwf.js and
birdwatcher.js. For the last case, you need to have a BirdWatcher
server running on node.js. Please check the following steps.

    npm install socket.io
    git clone git://github.com/imaya/birdwatcher.js.git
    cd birdwatcher.js/server
    vi config.js  # if you need to change the port number.
    node server.js

## How To Start

Invoke the following.

    rackup lwfs.ru

## Configuration

You may configure LWFS on its start-up with ~/Desktop/LWFS_work/lwfs.conf:

    // -*- mode: javascript; tab-width: 4; -*-

~/Desktop/LWFS_work/ to control "local/dynamic" settings for the
folder and descendant folders of the folder.

## Requirements

### Ruby

ruby-1.9.3 is required. jruby-1.7.0 is also okay.

### HTTP Server

shinatra-\*.gem and thin-\*.gem (and their dependencies including
rack-*.gem, etc) are utilized.

### HTTP Client

httpclient-\*.gem is utilized for posting file system events to
the LWFS http server.

### UUID Tools

uuidtools-\*.gem is utilized for generating a UUID for each
PC. This UUID is necessary to keep multiple users' folders
simultaneously on the remote rsyncd server.

### File System Events

rb-fseven-\*.gem, rb-inotify-\*.gem, or wdm-\*.gem is utilized.

### LZMA

vendor/cache/ruby-lzma-\*.gem
(https://github.com/KojiNakamaru/ruby-lzma/tree/develop), a variant to
work with ruby-1.9.3, is utilized.

### XML

vendor/cache/libxml-ruby-\*.gem
(https://github.com/KojiNakamaru/libxml-ruby/tree/develop) is utilized
to accelerate parsing xml data. This is a variant of the original
libxml-ruby-\*.gem to be built for both Windows MinGW ruby and Mac
OS X rbenv ruby.

### ActionCompiler

lib/swf2lwf/gems/actioncompiler-\*.gem
(https://github.com/gree/lwf/tree/master/tools/swf2lwf/gems) for
parsing actions.

### Image

lib/swf2lwf/gems/rb-img-\*.gem (gems/rb-img-\*/), a custom extension for
saving image data in png/jpg, is utilized. Although there are several
gems for saving image data, each of them may have following issues:

* Obsolete and cannot work with ruby-1.9.3.
* Difficult to be built on Windows, MinGW ruby. Perhaps there is no
  big issue if we target Cygwin ruby.
